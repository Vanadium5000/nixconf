# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

Initializing memory bank for NixOS configuration flake project. This is a comprehensive setup for MacBook hardware with modular architecture using flake-parts, hjem for user management, and various tools for development and desktop environment.

## Recent Changes

- Created initial memory bank files (brief.md, product.md, context.md)
- Analyzed entire codebase structure including flake.nix, modules, and configurations
- Identified key components: Hyprland desktop, DankMaterialShell, VSCodium, impermanence, disko partitioning
- Redesigned temp emails system in passmenu.ts: new directory structure temp_emails/{account}/{email}, enhanced management with copy/autotype options for links

## Next Steps

- Complete memory bank initialization with architecture.md, tech.md, and tasks.md
- Verify all configurations are correct and complete
- Test flake check and build processes
- Document any missing components or improvements needed
